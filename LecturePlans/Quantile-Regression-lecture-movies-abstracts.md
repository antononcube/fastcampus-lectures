# Quantile Regression movies

This document has short descriptions of the movies of the (proposed) Quantile Regression (QR) lectures.
Each movie is planned to be ~ 20 minutes. 

Each description answers the questions: Why? What? How? 


## Who am I?

- Why should you listen to me?
 
   - Shot biography:
   
     - Anton Antonov, Senior Research Scientist at Accendo Data, LLC    
   
     - Anton is an applied mathematician (PhD) with 28+ years of experience in algorithm development, scientific computing, mathematical modeling, operations research, natural language processing, machine learning, data science, and data mining.   
     
     - In the last twelve years, he focused on developing machine learning algorithms and workflows for different industries (music, movies, points of interests, recruiting, healthcare.) Currently, he is working on operations research and data science applications to manufacturing and healthcare.   
     
     - Anton is a former kernel developer of Mathematica.

- What I have done in the QR field?

  - I created a few packages for doing QR in Wolfram Language (WL); also a package in R.
  The WL / Mathematica package is cited in Wikipedia.
  Here is a related Wolfram Function Repository (WFR) implementation: 
  [`QuantileRegression`](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/QuantileRegression).

## Introducing QR through answering different questions
   
- Why?
 
  - It is better to give and overview of QR through questions and answers.
  
  - This is both of an advertisement of QR and an advertisement for this QR lecture set.
  
- What is the movie content:

  - Basic QR properties, advantages, and disadvantages.
  
  - Brief descriptions of simple and important use cases of QR applications.
  
  - Outline of the QR lecture set.    

## Quantile Regression packages  
  
- What?
 
  - How to get the R packages `quantreg` and `QRMon`?
  
  - How to make simple computations with `quantreg`?
  
  - How to make both simple and complicated computations with `QRMon`?
  
- How?

  - This is most likely are live-coding session.
  
    
## Basic applications of QR (part 1)

- What?
 
  - Simple QR workflows.
  
  - Finding conditional propabilities.
 
  - Finding outliers.
  
  - The flow chart for QR workflows.
  
- Why?

  - Of course it is good idea to start with the basics: 
  
     - How to make basic, fundamental QR computations?
     
- How?

  - This is most likely a live-coding session.
  

## Basic applications of QR (part 2)

- Partitioning of the signal

- Simulations


## Predict the temperature of tomorrow from the temperature of today

- Problem formulation: (1) general, colloquial description, and (2) rigorous description.

- Chosing different datasets.

- Application to business resources planning.

- Not just temperatures.

           
## Time series analysis topics

- De-trending

- Representation by a basis of functions

- Model based decompositions


## Anomaly detection with QR

- Structural breaks
        
- Variance anomalies

- Point anomalies

- Contextual anomalies

- How to derive measures of success?

## Applications of QR to finance
