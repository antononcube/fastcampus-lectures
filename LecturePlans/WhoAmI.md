# Introduction lecture (Who am I?)

## Education

- MSc Computer Science (Data Bases)
- MSc Mathematics (Abstract Algebra)
- PhD Applied Mathematics (Large Scale Air-Pollution Simulations)

## Working for Wolfram Research Inc.

- I am a former Kernel Developer of Mathematica -- I worked at Wolfram Research, Inc. (WRI) from 2001 to 2008.
- At WRI I was developing mostly numerical algorithms.
  - I designed, implemented, and extensively documented the new [`NIntegrate`](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/NIntegrate.html).

## Senior Data Scientist

- Since 2008 I have worked mostly as a "Senior Data Scientist".

- I am also very interested Operations Research. (And worked in that field.)

## General point of view on AI

- Siding with the Weak AI.

- See the related blog post and panel video from the Data Science Salon Miami February 2018. 
  - ["Applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to Finance and Technology"](https://mathematicaforprediction.wordpress.com/2018/02/21/applying-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-to-finance-and-technology/)

## Coding

- I have produced 
  [multiple R-packages](https://github.com/antononcube/R-packages) 
  at this point in order to facilitate different Machine Learning and Data Science workflows.

  - See ["How to simplify Machine learning workflows specifications - useR! 2020 Conference"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqH6eha73xk)
  
- I am very interested in comparison of different programming languages and systems.
  See [MathematicaVsR](https://github.com/antononcube/MathematicaVsR).
  
- I have also done extensive COVID-19 modeling and coding. 
  See [Coronavirus propagation dynamics](https://github.com/antononcube/SystemModeling/tree/master/Projects/Coronavirus-propagation-dynamics)
