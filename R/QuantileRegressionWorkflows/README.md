# Quantile Regression Workflows 

**Mission statement:**

The goals of this (workshop) lectures are to:

- Introduce the theoretical background of Quantile Regression (QR),

- Demonstrate QR's practical (and superior) abilities to deal with "real life" time series data

- Teach how to rapidly create QR workflows using R

## Packages

The QR packages used are `quantreg` and `QRMon`.

To install them use the commands:

```r
install.packages("quantreg")
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github(repo = "antononcube/QRMon-R" )
```
